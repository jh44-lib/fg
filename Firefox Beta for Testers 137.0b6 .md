Firefox Beta is the experimental version of the well-known Firefox browser from Mozilla, designed for Android tablets and smartphones. It is available for free and has been downloaded over 10 million times by Android users worldwide, making it one of the top apps. The main version of Mozilla Firefox has been available for a long time and is downloaded thousands of times daily, ranking among the best mobile web browsers. You might wonder, why the beta version? Whatâ€™s the difference between the main and beta versions? 

Mozilla has released this beta version to allow users to install it on their devices and experience features beyond those of the main version. The goal is to identify and resolve any issues the browser may have on different devices. Once Mozilla ensures that the new features work seamlessly across all devices, they will update the main version accordingly.
