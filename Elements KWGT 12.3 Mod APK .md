Personalization is one of the key features of Android, making it stand out among operating systems. This extensive capability has contributed to Android's significant market share. Users have several options for customizing their environment and interface, one of which is widgets. Widgets are one of the most appealing features of Android, allowing users to meet their needs without installing heavy applications or even launching them. 

Android comes with a variety of default widgets, each designed to address specific user needs. Additionally, many developers create widgets to enhance user functionality, which can be used on the home screen or lock screen. However, a notable limitation is that users cannot edit these default widgets. 

As mentioned, Android users cannot make changes to widgets by default, but there is an exceptional app called **KWGT** that addresses this issue. This app, which we have introduced in previous posts, allows you to easily create your own custom widgets using a range of editing tools, maximizing the benefits of these personalized designs. The growing user base of KWGT has led some developers to create and publish ready-made widgets for this app. 

Today, we would like to introduce you to a collection of pre-designed widgets. **Elements KWGT** is a set of unique and ready-made KWGT widgets developed by Droid Beauty and available on Google Play. By installing this app, you gain access to several pre-designed widgets in KWGT that cater to your needs. The widgets offered in this app serve various functions, and the choice of which to use is entirely up to the user. Simply select a widget and activate it. The scaling settings allow you to adjust the size of the widgets according to your device's screen dimensions.
